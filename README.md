# Interview exercises

## First one

- [x] the search box must be case insensitive

## Second one

- [ ] Create a function to format the price in USD format

## Third One

- [x] The search is executing the request every time the user types, so we want to prevent that by making the user feel that the request is made once he finishes typing, sleep the request a 1s

## Fourth one

- [ ] Create an endpoint in the api file to be able to order the products alphabetically or by price, the ordering by price must be from highest to lowest, then add a select in the frontend to execute the request.

## Extra Point

- [ ] The query and order preference should be persisted on page reload

- [ ] The app takes a few seconds to display the products without displaying a "Loading..."
